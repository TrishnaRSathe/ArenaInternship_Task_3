This is a console-based Library Management System built using Java and OOP concepts. It helps manage books and members efficiently by allowing users to add books, register members, search books, and handle borrowing and returning operations. The project uses classes, encapsulation, and collections to demonstrate real-world library workflows in a clear, menu-driven format, making it ideal for beginners learning Core Java and object-oriented programming.
